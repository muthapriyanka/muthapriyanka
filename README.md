I am a passionate software engineer dedicated to solving complex problems and delivering high-quality, detail-oriented solutions with a get-it-done attitude. Currently pursuing an Master's in Software Engineering (GPA: 3.9/4.0) at San Jose State University, I bring hands-on expertise in Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), data structures, and algorithms (DSA) to build scalable and efficient systems.

With industry experience, I have successfully tackled technical challenges while also demonstrating leadership and mentorship in team-driven environments. My goal is to combine technical excellence and problem-solving skills to drive innovation and enhance customer satisfaction.
