As a results-driven software engineer with 3+ years of industry experience at Tata Consultancy Services and a Master’s in Software Engineering (GPA: 3.9/4.0) from San José State University, I bring strong expertise in building scalable, efficient, and reliable software systems.

My skill set spans the full Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), with hands-on experience in Java, Spring Boot, React.js, REST APIs, and AWS. At TCS, I successfully replaced manual risk tracking systems with web-based platforms (improving data accuracy by 80%) and developed RESTful services that improved performance and reduced booking errors by 30%.

I thrive in collaborative, Agile environments and am passionate about solving real-world problems using data structures and algorithms.
